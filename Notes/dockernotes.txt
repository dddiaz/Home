docker dev has the code mounted instead of backed in to reflect changes faster
remeber if u push dev anywhere u will need to rebuild image

use docker-compose up to start app
use docker-compose build to rebuild
or use docker-compose up --build to rebuild and run

I was having an issue where it seemed like the docker-comose.dev.yml was not mounting my app,
so I couldnâ€™t see my changes reflected without restarting the app every time.
I changed the file name to docker-compose.override.yml, and that seems to have fixed the problem.

TODO: need to figure out how deploying will work
and if i need to ignore the docker override file somehow
