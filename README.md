# Future Home of my personal website

#### @ www.dddiaz.com

This is my personal website. It is build with Python, Flask, MongoDB, DynamoDB, and Docker.
It is deployed on AWS using code pipeline to automatically build and deploy changes pushed to Github.  
It also runs my personal blood glucose API that returns real time blood glucose data.

I hope you enjoy checking out the source.  
Nothing is ever perfect, but I am proud of what I have accomplished here.  
If you notice anything out of place, feel free to let me know!

#### Goals:
- Utilize Docker
- Continuous Delivery / Continuous Integration
- Python with Flask
- Blog
